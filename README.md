# Password-Generator

# Product-Description
### In this project I displayed what I have learned in the begininng stages of JavaScript by creating an application where you can randomly generate a password.
# Usage
### The password generator can be used in many different applications where a password is required. The password generator is useful when you cannot think of a original password yourself and need something that other cannot guess.
# Credits
### I would like to give credit to Eric Sayer for his knowledge of coding.
